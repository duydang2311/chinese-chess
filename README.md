> Xiangqi (Chinese: 象棋; pinyin: xiàngqí; Wade–Giles: Hsiang ch'i; English: /ˈʃɑːŋtʃi/), also called Chinese chess or Elephant chess, is a strategy board game for two players. Besides China and areas with significant ethnic Chinese communities, xiangqi is also a popular pastime in Vietnam, where it is known as **cờ tướng**.

###### Note: This was developed for school exams in a short amount of time. Unfortunately, there are few memory leaks in the program (did my best to look into the GC of C# though).
